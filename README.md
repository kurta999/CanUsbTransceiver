# CanUsbTransceiver

A simple CAN<->USB Transceiver with the help of STM32G474RET Nucleo board, Waveshare SN65HVD230 CAN Transceiver & Any FT232 UART<->USB  Adapter. The default baudrate is 500kbit/s, it's hardcoded. I didn't need to change it yet.

Dekstop application for this firmware can be found here.

If you just want the desktop application, just buy Lawicel CAN USB.
